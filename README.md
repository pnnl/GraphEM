# GraphEM: Unsupervised Segmentation of Electron Microscopy Data

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the unsupervised segmentation of electron microscopy data, as described in the paper "Revealing the Evolution of Order in Materials Microstructures Using Multi-Modal Computer Vision." The code uses a graph-based approach to segment images and EDS data into distinct regions based on their structural and chemical features. 

## Data

STEM/EDS data supporting this work are availble on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Epitaxial_LaFeO_sub_3_sub_SrTiO_sub_3_sub_films_before_and_after_irradiation/27633015).
