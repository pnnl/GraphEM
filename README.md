# GraphEM: Unsupervised Segmentation of Electron Microscopy Data

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the unsupervised segmentation of electron microscopy data, as described in the paper "Revealing the Evolution of Order in Materials Microstructures Using Multi-Modal Computer Vision." The code uses a graph-based approach to segment images and EDS data into distinct regions based on their structural and chemical features.
